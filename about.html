		<p>We are incredibly fortunate to live in the technology age which aided in finding places to go, but in limited supply.  I'd spend hours 
		searching for a list of parks or scouring maps, looking for anything that resembled a large field and would zoom in to further investigate 
		the features associated with the grass, hoping for a ballfield, a playground or other amenities.</p>

		<p>As my kids grow older and our time together becomes more and more important, the realization that I didn't have those hours to scour
		web coupled with my boys' desire to go to new places culminated to form our own park finder. A list of places we'd visited with 
		the features offered at each location. </p>
		
		<p>We now want to offer our "Research" for everyone to get out and find something new and beautiful to share 
		with their loved ones, their pets or even just their own inner child. </p>
